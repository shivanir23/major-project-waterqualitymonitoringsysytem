Abstract
Water pollution is one of the biggest fears of green globalization. In order to ensure the safe supply of the drinking water the quality needs to be monitor in real time. In this paper, I present a design and development of a low-cost system for real-time monitoring of the water quality management in IOT. The system consists of several sensors that are used to measuring physical and chemical parameters in the water. The parameters such as temperature, PH, turbidity, the Level sensor of the water can be measured. The measured values from the sensors can be processed by the microcontroller. 

COMPONENTS REQUIRED
Arduino UNO & GENUINO UNO,A7 GPRS/GPS Module, temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen level sensors,turbidity sensor,Power source

Arduino Genuino 101 is interfaced to 4 sensors. All of them requires some interfacing because they are current-output sensors. Arduino Genuino 101 collects the measurements data periodically, gets the GPS coordinates, and uploads the data bundle into a database using GPRS data link.I use temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen level sensors in this project.The other sensor is a turbidity sensor, which output a voltage level proportional to the amount of suspended solid particles in the water.I used Li-Ion battries for my power source.




CONCLUSION
Hence IOT is used to develop a integerated automated water quality monitoring system which helps in monitoring,saves time,collects information to make quality decisions.
